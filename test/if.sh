# This script is invoked by Travis testing and inspects
# the changeset that's being built.
#
# Usage:
#
#    if.sh <label> && something_else
#
# The intention is to be able to ONLY test certain aspects
# when special conditions are satisfied.
#
# Notes:
#    JS tests are expected to be very fast
#    We shouldn't skip tests when it affects Coverage negatively
#    We can possibly do tests based on which branch is pushed to
#
# https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/27
#
# What changes are analyzed?
#
# For this script, we should mainly use Travis' env
# $TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE. The reason is simple: You cannot tell what
# changes have been implemented since last test, thus if your
# condtion should fire or not.
#
# Definition:
# TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE: The range of commits that were included in
# the push or pull request.
