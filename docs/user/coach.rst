Coach
=====

You can view *Coach Reports* to track progress of the **Learner** users and usage stats for individual exercises from the **Coach** dashboard.


Recent Activity View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default view when you access the **Coach** dashboard from the main navigation menu. It displays the following information for recently accessed items (exercises and resources - videos, reading material, etc.) for the selected Kolibri channel:

* Percentage of average progress for all recent items
* List of recently accessed items sorted by average progress percentage.

.. Radina TO-DO: Exclude main navigation bar from the final version of the screenshot for simplicity.

.. _topic_view:
