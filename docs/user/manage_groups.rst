Manage Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you need to further divide learners inside classes, for example to address the different progress needs or levels, you can use the **Groups** feature. Create and delete groups, as well as assign learners to them from the **Groups** tab in your **Coach** dashboard. Default view displays the list of all groups for the selected class, with the list of assigned learners for each group.
