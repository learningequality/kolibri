Kolibri User Guide
==================

**Kolibri** is an open-source educational platform specially designed to provide offline access to a wide range of quality, openly licensed educational content in low-resource contexts like rural schools, refugee camps, orphanages, and also in non-formal school programs.

Kolibri can serve high quality education content from several publicly available **content channels**, collections of educational resources (exercises, videos, audio or document files) and associated metadata, prepared and organized for their use in Kolibri. It also works in conjuntion with `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org>`_, the tool used to organize content and build custom content channels, aligned to the local curricula, or according to specific learning needs.
