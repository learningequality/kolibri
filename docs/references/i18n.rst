Internationalization
====================

As a platform intended for use around the world, Kolibri has a strong mandate for translation and internationalization. As such, it has been designed with technologies to enable this built in.


Writing localized strings
-------------------------

Backend
~~~~~~~

For any strings in Django, we are using the standard Django i18n machinery (gettext and associated functions) to provide translations. See the `Django i18n documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/i18n/>`_ for more information.

Frontend
~~~~~~~~

For any strings in the frontend, we are using `Vue-Intl <https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-intl>`_ an in house port of `React-intl <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl>`_.

Within Kolibri, messages are defined on the body of the Vue component:

.. code-block:: javascript

  name: 'componentName'
  $trs: {
    msgId: 'Message text',
  }

The ``name`` and every ``msgId`` should be in camelCase.

User visible strings should be rendered directly in the template with ``{{ $tr('msgId') }}``. These strings are collected during the build process, and bundled into exported JSON files. These files are then uploaded to Crowdin for translation.

An example Vue component would then look like this

.. code-block:: html

  <template>
    <div>
      <p>{{ $tr('exampleMessage') }}</p>
    </div>
  </template>


.. code-block:: javascript

    module.exports = {
      name: 'example',
      $trs: {
        exampleMessage: 'This message is just an example',
      },
    };

In order to translate strings in Javascript source files, the namespace and messages are defined like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

  import { createTranslator } from 'kolibri.utils.i18n';
  const name = 'exampleTitles';
  const messages = {
    msgIdForThisMessage: 'This is a message',
  };
  const translator = createTranslator(name, messages);
  console.log(translator.$tr('msgIdForThisMessage'));


In this way, messages are namespaced, and then available off the ``$tr`` method of the translator object returned from the createTranslator function.

These messages will then be discovered for any registered plugins and loaded into the page if that language is set as the Django language. All language setting for the Frontend is based off the current Django language for the request.

All front-end translations can be parameterized using `ICU message syntax <https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/>`_.


.. _crowdin:

Crowdin workflow
----------------

We use the Crowdin platform to enable third parties to translate the strings in our application.

Note that you have to specify branch names for most commands.

.. note:: These notes are only for the Kolibri application. For translation of user documentation, please see the `kolibri-docs repository <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-docs/>`_.


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you'll need to have these dependencies available on your path:

* GNU ``gettext``
* Java

You may be able to install them using your system's package manager.

Next, download the crowdin jar to the current directory using this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make translation-crowdin-install


Finally, ensure you have an environment variable ``CROWDIN_API_KEY`` set to the Learning Equality organization `account API key <https://support.crowdin.com/api/api-integration-setup/>`_.

.. note:: We do not currently support making translations on Windows. It might be possible, but would require inspection of the Makefile and running alternate commands.

.. note:: If you install ``gettext`` on Mac with Homebrew, you may need to add the binary to your path manually


Exporting and uploading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically, strings will be uploaded when a new release branch is cut from ``develop``, signifying the beginning of string freeze and the ``beta`` releases.

Before translators can begin working on the strings in our application, they need to be uploaded to Crowdin. Translations are maintained in release branches on Crowdin in the `Crowdin kolibri project <http://crowdin.com/project/kolibri>`_.

This command will extract front- and backend strings from the Kolibri application code:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make translation-extract

And this command will upload the strings to Crowdin:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make translation-crowdin-upload branch=[release-branch-name]

The branch name will typically look something like: ``release-v0.8.x``

Next, apply `translation memory <https://support.crowdin.com/translation-memory/#applying-translation-memory-via-pre-translation>`_ via the Crowdin UI to copy over perfect matches from previous releases for all languages. This could take some time.

Now, some percentage of the newly updated strings should show as already having been translated in crowdin because the perfect matches were automatically copied over.


Fetching and building translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to get the newly translated strings into the application, they need to be downloaded from Crowdin and checked in to the Kolibri github repo.

.. warning:: By default Crowdin will download all translations, not just approved ones. It will often download untranslated strings also. You must manually delete files that are not relevant.

You can download them using this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make translation-crowdin-download branch=[release-branch-name]

This will update local translation files. Find and delete all files for unsupported or partially-translated languages. Then, check in new strings to git and submit them in a PR to the release branch.

Finally, build the backend .mo files for Django:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make translation-django-compilemessages


.. _new_language:

Adding a newly supported language
---------------------------------

In order to add a new supported language to Kolibri, the appropriate language information object must be added to the array in ``kolibri/locale/supported_languages.json``.

The language must be described using the following keys, with everything in lower case

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "language_code": "<Two or three letter language code>",
    "language_name": "<Language name in the target language>",
    "territory_code": "<Optional: Language territory code>",
    "script_code": "<Optional: Language script code>"
    "english_name": "<Optional: Language name in English>"
  }

Any time a language is added to supported languages the command ``yarn run generate-locale-data`` must be run, and the resulting file changes committed to the code base.

If a language is added that is not part of the natively supported languages for Django, then a Django mo file must be compiled for that language using ``make translation-django-compilemessages``, and the resulting mo file committed to the code base.
