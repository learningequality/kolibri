Internationalization
====================

As a platform intended for use around the world, Kolibri has a strong mandate for translation and internationalization. As such, it has been designed with technologies to enable this built in.


Writing localized strings
-------------------------

For strings in the frontend, we are using `Vue-Intl <https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-intl>`__, an in house port of `React-intl <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl>`__. Strings are collected during the build process, and bundled into exported JSON files.

Messages will be discovered for any registered plugins and loaded into the page if that language is set as the Django language. All language setting for the frontend are based off the current Django language for the HTTP request.


.vue files
~~~~~~~~~~

Within Kolibri .vue components, messages are defined in the ``<script>`` section as attributes of the component definition:

.. code-block:: javascript

  export default {
    name: 'componentName',
    $trs: {
      msgId1: 'Message text 1',
      msgId2: 'Message text 2',
    },
  };


The component names and message IDs should all be camelCase.

User visible strings can be used anywhere in the .vue file using ``$tr('msgId')`` (in the template) or ``this.$tr('msgId')`` (in the script).


An example Vue component would then look like this

.. code-block:: html

  <template>
    <div>
      <!-- puts 'Hello world' in paragraph -->
      <p>{{ $tr('helloWorld') }}</p>
    </div>
  </template>


  <script>

    export default {
      name: 'someComponent',
      mounted() {
        // prints 'Hello world' to console
        console.log((this.$trs('helloWorld'));
      },
      $trs: {
        helloWorld: 'Hello world',
      },
    };

  </script>


.js files
~~~~~~~~~

In order to translate strings in Javascript source files, the namespace and messages are defined like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

  import { createTranslator } from 'kolibri.utils.i18n';
  const name = 'someModule';
  const messages = {
    helloWorld: 'Hello world',
  };
  const translator = createTranslator(name, messages);

Then messages are available from the ``$tr`` method on the translator object:

.. code-block:: javascript

  console.log(translator.$tr('helloWorld'));

ICU message syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All frontend translations can be parameterized using `ICU message syntax <https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/>`__. Additional documentation is `available on crowdin <https://support.crowdin.com/icu-message-syntax/>`__.

This syntax can be used to do things like inject variables, pluralize words, and localize numbers.

Dynamic values are passed into translation strings as named arguments in an object. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  export default {
    name: 'anothetComponent',
    mounted() {
      // outputs 'Henry read 2 stories'
      console.log(this.$tr('msg', {name: 'Henry', count: 2}));
    },
    $trs: {
      msg: '{name} read {count} {count, plural, one {story} other {stories}}',
    },
  };

.py files
~~~~~~~~~

For any user-facing strings in python files, we are using standard Django tools (``gettext`` and associated functions). See the `Django i18n documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/i18n/>`__ for more information.


RTL language support
--------------------

Kolibri has full support for right-to-left languages, and all functionality should work equally well when displayed in both LTR and RTL languages.

There are a number of important considerations to take into account with RTL content. `Material Design has an excellent article <https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html>`_ that covers most important topics at a high level.

.. warning::

  Right-to-left support is broken when running the development server with hot reloading enabled (``yarn run devserver-hot``)


Text alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alignment of application text  (i.e. text using ``$tr`` syntax) is mostly handled "automagically" by the `RTLCSS framework <https://rtlcss.com/>`_. This means that application text should have CSS applied to it  as though it is written in English. For example, if you want the text aligned left for LTR languages and right for RTL, simply use ``text-align: left``. This will be automatically flipped to ``text-align: right`` by the webpack plugin. Since the application is only ever viewed in one language at a time, RTLCSS can apply these changes to all CSS at once.

On the other hand, alignment of user-generated text (from databases or from content) is inherently unknown beforehand. Therefore all user-generated text must have ``dir="auto"`` set on a parent DOM node. This can get especially complicated when LTR and RTL content are `mixed inline bidirectionally <https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/>`_. Read more about the `Unicode Bidirectional algorithm <https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics>`_.

A rule of thumb for inline bidirectional text:

* if user-generated text is on its own in a block-level DOM element, it should be aligned based on the text's language using ``dir="auto"`` on the block-level element.
* if user-generated text is displayed inline with application text (such as "App Label: user text"), it should be aligned using CSS ``text-align`` on the block-level element, and ``dir="auto"`` on a ``span`` wrapping the inline user text.


Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Occasionally it is necessary to perform different logic depending on the directionalty of the the currently-selected language. For example, the handling of a button that changes horizontal scroll position would need to flip direction.

In the frontend, we provide a ``isRtl`` property attached to every Vue instance. For example, you could write Vue methods like:

.. code-block:: javascript

  previous() {
    if (this.isRtl) this.scrollRight();
    else this.scrollLeft();
  },
  next() {
    if (this.isRtl) this.scrollLeft();
    else this.scrollRight();
  },

If you need to get the current language directionality on the backend, you can use ``django.utils.translation.get_language_bidi``.


Iconography
~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing whether or not to mirror icons in RTL languages is a subtle decision. Some icons should be flipped, but not others. From the `Material guidelines <https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icons-in-rtl>`_:

    *anything that relates to time should be depicted as moving from right to left. For example, forward points to the left, and backwards points to the right*

It is recommended to use the ``KIcon`` component when possible, as this will handle RTL flipping for you and apply it when appropriate, as well as taking care of other details:

.. code-block:: html

  <KIcon icon="forward" />


If ``KIcon`` does not have the icon you need or is not usable for some reason, we also provide a global CSS class ``rtl-icon`` which will flip the icon. This can be applied conditionally with the ``isRtl`` property, e.g.:

.. code-block:: html

  <img src="forward.png" :class="{ 'is-rtl': isRtl }" alt="" />


Content rendererers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User interfaces that are tightly coupled to embedded content, such as the 'next page' and 'previous page' buttons in a book, need to be flipped to match the language direction of that content. UIs that are not tightly integrated with the content should match the overall application language, not the content.

Information about content language direction is available in the computed props ``contentDirection`` and ``contentIsRtl`` from ``kolibri.coreVue.mixins.contentRendererMixin``. These can be used to change styling and directionality dynamically, similar to the application-wide ``isRtl`` value.

In situations where we are using third-party libraries it might be necessary to flip the entire content renderer UI automatically using the RTLCSS framework rather than make targeted changes to the DOM. To handle these cases, it's possible to dynamically load the correct CSS webpack bundle using a promise:

.. code-block:: javascript

  export default {
    name: 'SomeContentRenderer',
    created() {
      // load alternate CSS
      this.cssPromise = this.$options.contentModule.loadDirectionalCSS(this.contentDirection);
    },
    mounted() {
      this.cssPromise.then(() => {
        // initialize third-party library when the vue is mounted AND the CSS is loaded
      });
    },
  };


.. _crowdin:

Crowdin workflow
----------------

We use the Crowdin platform to enable third parties to translate the strings in our application.

Note that you have to specify branch names for most commands.

.. note:: These notes are only for the Kolibri application. For translation of user documentation, please see the `kolibri-docs repository <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-docs/>`__.

.. note:: The Kolibri Crowdin workflow relies on the project having the "Duplicate strings" setting set to "Show – translators will translate each instance separately". If this is not set, the workflow will not function as expected!


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you'll need to have GNU ``gettext`` available on your path. You may be able to install it using your system's package manager.

.. note:: If you install ``gettext`` on Mac with Homebrew, you may need to add the binary to your path manually

Next, ensure you have an environment variable ``CROWDIN_API_KEY`` set to the Learning Equality organization `account API key <https://support.crowdin.com/api/api-integration-setup/>`__.

Finally, you'll need to install the Perseus Plugin (``kolibri_exercise_perseus_plugin`` Python package) in development mode. This is done by `checking out the repo <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-exercise-perseus-plugin#development-guide>`__ and then installing it to Kolibri by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e [local_path_to_perseus_repo]

This will allow the scripts to properly upload sources and download translations from and to the Perseus plugin, which may then need to be released if any strings have changed or if new languages were added.

See the `Perseus plugin development guide <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-exercise-perseus-plugin#development-guide>`__ for more information on setup and publication.

When uploading or downloading strings, ensure that your Perseus repo is in a clean checkout state with the correct Perseus branch.


Extracting and uploading sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically, strings will be uploaded when a new release branch is cut from ``develop``, signifying the beginning of string freeze and the ``beta`` releases. (See :ref:`release_process`.)

Before translators can begin working on the strings in our application, they need to be uploaded to Crowdin. Translations are maintained in release branches on Crowdin in the `Crowdin kolibri project <http://crowdin.com/project/kolibri>`__.

.. warning:: You *must* have the Perseus plugin installed for development as described above, or not all strings will be extracted!

This command will extract front- and backend strings and upload them to Crowdin, and may take a while:

.. code-block:: bash

  make i18n-upload branch=[release-branch-name]

The branch name will typically look something like: ``release-v0.8.x``

Pre-translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running the ``i18n-upload`` command above, the newly created branch should have some percentage of strings in supported languages shown as both translated and approved. These strings are the *exact* matches from the previous release, meaning that both the string IDs and the English text is exactly the same.

At this point, it is often desirable to apply some form of pre-translation to the remaining strings using Crowdin's "translation memory" functionality. There are two ways to do this: with and without auto-approval.

To run pre-translation without auto-approval **(recommended)**:

.. code-block:: bash

  make i18n-pretranslate branch=[release-branch-name]

Or to run pre-translation with auto-approval:

.. code-block:: bash

  make i18n-pretranslate-approve-all branch=[release-branch-name]

.. warning:: The exact behavior of Crowdin's translation memory is not specified. Given some English phrase, it is not always possible to predict what suggested translation it will make. Therefore, auto-approval be used with caution.


Displaying stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every release, we need to let translators for each language know how much work they will have to do. In order to see how many new strings and words are in a particular release, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  make i18n-stats branch=[release-branch-name]

This will give you some output like this:

.. code-block:: text

    Branch: develop-alpha

    New since last release:
    -------------  ---
    Total strings   67
    Total words    402
    -------------  ---

    Untranslated:
    Language                        Strings    Words
    ----------------------------  ---------  -------
    ** average, all languages **         49      370
    Arabic                               48      366
    Bengali                              47      370
    ...
    Yoruba                               50      375
    Zulu                                 49      367


This information can be provided to translators; it's also available on the Crowdin website.


Downloading translations to Kolibri
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As translators work on Crowdin, we will periodically retrieve the latest updates and commit them to Kolibri's codebase. In the process, we'll also update the custom fonts that are generated based on the translated application text.

First, you need to download source fonts from Google. In order to do this, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make i18n-download-source-fonts

Next, we download the latest translations from Crowdin and rebuild a number of dependent files which will be checked in to git. Do this using the command below. **It can take a long time!**

.. code-block:: bash

    make i18n-update branch=[release-branch-name]

This will do a number of things for you:

* Rebuild the crowdin project (note that builds can only happen once every 30 minutes, as per the Crowdin API)
* Download and update all translations for the currently supported languages
* Run Django's ``compilemessages`` command
* Regenerate all font and css files
* Regenerate Intl JS files

Check in all the updated files to git and submit them in a PR to the release branch.

.. note:: Remember about Perseus! Check if files in that repo have changed too, and submit a separate PR. It will be necessary to release a new version and referencing it in Kolibri's ``base.txt`` requirements file.


.. _new_language:

Adding a newly supported language
---------------------------------

In order to add a new supported language to Kolibri, the appropriate language information object must be added to the array in ``kolibri/locale/supported_languages.json``.

.. warning::

  Always test a newly added language thoroughly because there are many things that can go wrong. At a minumum, ensure that you can run the development server, switch to the language, and navigate around the app (including Perseus exercises). Additionally, ensure that the fonts are `rendered with Noto <https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/09/DevTools-answers-What-font-is-that>`__.

The language must be described using the following keys, with everything in lower case

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "crowdin_code":   "[Code used to refer to the language on Crowdin]",
    "intl_code":      "[Lowercase code from Intl.js]",
    "language_name":  "[Language name in the target language]",
    "english_name":   "[Language name in English]",
    "default_font":   "[Name of the primary Noto font]"
  }


* For ``crowdin_code``, see `Crowdin language codes <https://support.crowdin.com/api/language-codes/>`__.
* For ``intl_code``, see `Supported Intl language codes <https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/tree/master/locale-data/jsonp>`__ and make it lowercase.
* For ``language_name`` and ``english_name``, refer to the `ISO 639 codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__. If necessary, use `this backup reference <http://helpsharepointvision.nevron.com/Culture_Table.html>`__. If the language is a dialect specific to a region, include the name of the region in parentheses after the language name.
* For the ``default_font``, we use variants of Noto Sans. Search the `Noto database <https://www.google.com/get/noto/>`__ to see which font supports the language you are adding.

If the language doesn't exist in Django, you may get errors when trying to view the language. In this case it needs to be added to ``EXTRA_LANG_INFO`` in ``base.py``. Additionally, for this language to work during development, the django.mo files for the language must be generated and committed to the repo. After running ``make i18n-update`` as described above, add the new file:

.. code-block:: bash

  git add --force kolibri/locale/[lang_code]/LC_MESSAGES/django.mo

The ``--force`` flag will bypass .gitignore


Updating font files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We pin our font source files to a particular commit in the `Google Noto Fonts <https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/>`__ github repo.

Google occasionally adds new font files and updates existing ones based on feedback from the community. They're also in the process of converting older-style fonts to their "Phase III" fonts, which are better for us because they can be merged together.

In order to update the version of the repo that we're using to the latest HEAD, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  python build_tools/i18n/fonts.py update-font-manifest

You can also specify a particular git hash or tag:

.. code-block:: bash

  python build_tools/i18n/fonts.py update-font-manifest [commit hash]

Make sure to test re-generating font files after updating the sources.

.. note:: We attempt to download fonts from the repo. It is possible that the structure of this repo will change over time, and the download script might need to be updated after changing which version of the repo we're pinned to.
