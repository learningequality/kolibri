Give Feedback
-------------

`Report issues on github <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues>`_. Please search the existing issues first to see if it's already been reported.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you are proposing a new feature or giving feedback on an existing feature:

* Explain in detail what you're trying to do and why the existing system isn't working for you
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to understand the specific problem you're trying to address


Write Code
----------

Look through the GitHub issues for issues you'd like to address. You can check our `upcoming milestones <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/milestones>`_ to look for high-priority items.

Then, visit :ref:`getting_started` to begin contributing.

Note that since Kolibri is still in development, the APIs are subject to change, and a lot of code is still in flux.


Write Documentation
-------------------

Kolibri could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Kolibri docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.
