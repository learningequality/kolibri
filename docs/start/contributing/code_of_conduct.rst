Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you
report it to the Learning Equality by emailing
codeofconduct@learningequality.org. All reports will be kept confidential. In
some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be
made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters
will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate
law enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to
notify them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the
space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage
you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports
where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an
actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the
incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not
violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve
the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

#. Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to
   follow up)
#. Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
   If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
   well.
#. When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
#. Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available
   record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public Slack logger) please
   include a link.
#. Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
#. If you believe this incident is ongoing.
#. Any other information you believe we should have.

What happens after you file a report?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will receive an email from the Code of Conduct committee
acknowledging receipt within 48 hours (we aim to be quicker than that).

The committee will immediately meet to review the incident and
determine:

#. What happened.
#. Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
#. Who the bad actor was.
#. Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to
   anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
safety, the committee's immediate priority will be to protect
everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until
we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically
safe.

Once the committee has a complete account of the events they will
make a decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

 * Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
 * A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s)
   involved.
 * A public reprimand.
 * An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a
   mailing list or Slack).
 * A permanent or temporary ban from some or all communication spaces (mailing
   lists, Slack, etc.)
 * A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with
either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet
resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original
reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll
take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of
our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.


Enforcement Manual
------------------

This is the enforcement manual followed by Learning Equality's Code of Conduct
Committee. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're
consistent and fair. It should be considered an internal document, but
we're publishing it publicly in the interests of transparency.

The Code of Conduct Committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code
of Conduct Committee ("the committee").

Learning Equality's (LE's) core team ("the core") will
establish this committee, comprised of at least three members.


How the committee will respond to reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a report is sent to the committee, a member will reply with a receipt
to confirm that a process of reading your report has started.

See the reporting guidelines for details of what reports should contain.
If a report doesn't contain enough information, the committee will
obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to
act on the LE's behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a
more complete account of events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best
of their ability:

 * what happened
 * whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation
 * who, if anyone, was the bad actor
 * whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to
   anyone's physical safety

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
committee's deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. Slack
transcripts, email discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

The committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one
week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time,
the committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected
timeline for resolution.


Acting Unilaterally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the act is ongoing or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of
violence), any committee member may act immediately (before reaching
consensus) to end the situation. In ongoing situations, any member may
at their discretion employ any of the tools available to the committee,
including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may
-- and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can
include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and
speaking on behalf of Learning Equality.

In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they
must report their actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.


Resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the committee
cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the committee will
turn the matter over to the board for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

 * Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
 * A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s)
   involved. In this case, the committee will deliver that reprimand to
   the individual(s) over email, cc'ing the committee.
 * A public reprimand. In this case, the committee will deliver that
   reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in Slack for
   an Slack violation; email for an email violation, etc.). The committee may
   choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
 * An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a
   mailing list or Slack). The committee will communicate this "vacation"
   to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation
   voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed
   to enforce this vacation.
 * A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Learning Equality spaces (mailing
   lists, Slack, etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so
   that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new Learning Equality
   fora, or otherwise maintained.
 * A request for a public or private apology. The committee may, if it chooses,
   attach "strings" to this
   request: for example, the committee may ask a violator to apologize in order
   to retain his or her membership on a mailing list.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the
committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties
and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this
resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.
However, the committee is not required to act on this feedback.

Finally, the committee will make a report for the core team.

The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public
statements will be made by the core team.

Conflicts of Interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event of any conflict of interest a committee member must
immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.

Changes made to the original doc: Instead of involving a board as DSF has,
the core team at Learning Equality is considered. Instead of IRC, we refer to
Slack. The Code of Conduct Committee does not have a single chair but acts as
a group to make conflicts of interest easier, and to avoid problems in case of
absence of the chair person. Instead of interchanging "working group" and
"committee" notation, we replaced all occurrences of "working group" and "group"
with "committee".
