Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

Give feedback
-------------

You can ask questions, make suggestions, and report issues in the `community forums <https://community.learningequality.org/>`__.

If you are proposing a new feature or giving feedback on an existing feature:

* Explain in detail what you're trying to do and why the existing system isn't working for you
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to understand the specific problem you're trying to address

If you have found a bug and are comfortable using Github and Markdown, you can create a `Github issue <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues>`__. Please search the existing issues first to see if it's already been reported.

Please make sure to use the template. Replace the HTML comments (the ``<!-- ... -->``) with the information requested.

Write code
----------

See `How can I contribute? <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

Write documentation
-------------------

If you'd like to help improve Kolibri's `User Documentation <https://kolibri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, see the `Kolibri docs Github repo <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri-docs>`__.

You can also help improve our developer documentation that you're reading now! These are in the main Kolibri repo.

Both our developer docs and the user docs are formatted using `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__.
