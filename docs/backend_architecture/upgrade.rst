Upgrading
=========

.. warning:: These instructions are under development

Upgrade paths
-------------

Kolibri can be automatically upgraded forwards. For instance, you can upgrade
from ``0.1->0.2`` and ``0.1->0.7``. For changes in the database schema
we use Django database migrations to manage these changes and make updates
on upgrade. When changes are made to model schema during development, then
these migrations can be generated by executing ``kolibri manage makemigrations``.

This will trigger the Django management command that will inspect the current
model schema, the current migrations, and generate new migrations to cover any
discrepancies. For some migrations, manual editing will be required to ensure
compatibility with Python 2 and 3 - this normally happens for Django Model fields
that take a ``choices`` keyword argument, where the choices are strings. The
strings should have no prefix (``u`` or ``b``) and the migration should contain
``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` as an import.

We also use the upgrade functionality triggered during the CLI
initialization to copy in new copies of static files that are used in the frontend
app. These upgrades are only triggered for a subset of our CLI commands - start,
services, manage, shell. Ones that ultimately start Django processes. In examining
``cli.py`` - those commands that are instantiated using the ``cls=KolibriDjangoCommand``
keyword argument will trigger this update behaviour.

As well as database migrations, there are also sometimes additional fixes that
are put into Kolibri in order to facilitate moving between versions. This may be
for bug fixing or efficiency purposes. These are sometimes carried out outside of
migrations in order to leverage the full Kolibri code base, which can be restricted
inside the contexts of Django data migrations.

In order to implement these upgrades, a decorator is available in ``kolibri.core.upgrade``,
``version_upgrade``. An toy example is shown below.

.. code-block:: python

  import logging
  from kolibri.core.upgrade import version_upgrade

  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  @version_upgrade(old_version="<0.6.4", new_version=">=1.0.0")
  def big_leap_upgrade():
      logger.warn("You've just upgraded from a very old version to a very new version!")

If placed into a file named ``upgrade.py`` either in a core app that is part of the ``INSTALLED_APPS``
Django setting, or is in an activated Kolibri plugin, this upgrade will be picked up and run any time
an upgrade happens from a Kolibri version older than ``0.6.4`` to a Kolibri version equal to or newer
than ``1.0.0``.
