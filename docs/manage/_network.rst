Network Terminology
-------------------

About IP addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``0.0.0.0`` = A special IP address on the **server** (your device running Kolibri and "serving" its content to others in the local network), which actually means "all available IP addresses". It's a kind of alias. But accessing ``0.0.0.0`` from another computer doesn't make sense and doesn't work. By default, Kolibri will serve on ``0.0.0.0``, which essentially means all IP addresses that are available on the device will render Kolibri accessible.
* ``127.0.0.1`` = A device's local IP address, meaning "myself". Some people joke and say "There's no place like 127.0.0.1", meaning "there's no place like home" :) This can be used on the serving device itself to test that Kolibri is running, in case you need a failsafe way of checking that Kolibri is in fact running and responsive.
* ``192.x.y.z`` = Addresses starting with ``192`` are local network IP addresses. The same thing can be said about ``10.x.y.z``. The address that you wanna use to enter on the clients/tablets in order to contact the server will in most cases start with ``192`` or ``10``.
* Port number: Kolibri runs on port ``8080``. When you access something on an IP address, you need a port. Ports can be open or closed on the server, but they can also be regulated by firewall rules on the way. ``http://`` <- this is the protocol that the browser reads out from the "URL", which is just some text that describes Kolibri.
* ``http://192.168.1.1:8080`` means: "Connect to IP address ``192.168.1.1`` on port ``8080`` with the HTTP protocol". The browser will the continue to try to reach this address, but may fail for instance if Kolibri isn't running, or if a step along the way blocks access.


Troubleshoot Network Problems
-----------------------------

#. Can you access Kolibri via ``http://127.0.0.1:8080``?
#. Can you access anything from the external IP of the device running Kolibri **FROM** the device itself?
#. Can you ping the external IP address from another device on the network?
