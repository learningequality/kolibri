msgstr "Front-end de Activos Cargando"

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:4
msgid "Asset pipelining is done using Webpack - this allows the use of require to import modules - as such all written code should be highly modular, individual files should be responsible for exporting a single function or object."
msgstr "Canalización de activos se realiza utilizando Webpack - esto permite el uso que se necesita para importar módulos - como tal el código escrito debe ser altamente modular, archivos individuales deben ser responsables de exportación de un objeto o función."

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:6
msgid "There are two distinct entities that control this behaviour - a Kolibri Hook on the Python side, which manages the registration of the frontend code within Django (and also facilitates building of that code into compiled assets with Webpack) and a Kolibri Module (a subclass of ``KolibriModule``) on the JavaScript side (see :doc:`frontend`)."
msgstr "Hay dos entidades distintas que controlan este comportamiento- un Kolibri Hook en el lado de Pynthon, el cual maneja el registro de el código de interfaz con Django ( Y también facilita la construcción de dicho código en activos compilados con Webpack) y un modulo Kolibri (una subclase de ``KolibriModule``) en el lado de JavaScript (ver:doc:`frontend`)."

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:8
msgid "Kolibri has a system for synchronously and asynchronously loading these bundled JavaScript modules which is mediated by a small core JavaScript app, ``kolibriGlobal``. Kolibri Modules define to which events they subscribe, and asynchronously registered Kolibri Modules are loaded by ``kolibriGlobal`` only when those events are triggered. For example if the Video Viewer's Kolibri Module subscribes to the *content_loaded:video* event, then when that event is triggered on ``kolibriGlobal`` it will asynchronously load the Video Viewer module and re-trigger the *content_loaded:video* event on the object the module returns."
msgstr "Kolibri tiene un sistema para cargar los módulos empacados de JavaScript de forma sincrónica y asincrónica, que es mediado por una pequeña aplicación núcleo de JavaScript, ``kolibriGlobal``. Los módulos Kolibri definen qué eventos van a escuchar, y los módulos registrados de forma asincrónica son cargador por ``kolibriGlobal`` sólo cuando esos eventos son activados. Por ejemplo, si el Módulo del Visor de Videos de Kolibri atiende el evento *content_loaded:video*, cuando ese evento sea activado después en ``kolibriGlobal``, este cargará el Módulo del Visor de Video de forma asincrónica y volverá a activar el evento *content_loaded:video* en el objeto que retorna el módulo."

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:10
msgid "Synchronous and asynchronous loading is defined by the template tag used to import the JavaScript for the Kolibri Module into the Django template. Synchronous loading merely inserts the JavaScript and CSS for the Kolibri Module directly into the Django template, meaning it is executed at page load."
msgstr "Carga sincrónica y asincronica de define por la etiqueta de la plantilla utilizada para importar el JavaScript para el Modulo Kolibri en la plantilla de Django. La carga sincrónica simplemente inserta el JavaScript y el CSS para el modulo Kolibri directamente en la plantilla de Django lo que significa que es ejecutado en la carga de la pagina."

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:12
msgid "This can be achieved in two ways using tags defined in *kolibri/core/webpack/templatetags/webpack_tags.py*."
msgstr "Puede ser alcanzado de dos formas usando las etiquetas definidas en *kolibri/core/webpack/templatetags/webpack_tags.py*."

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:14
msgid "The first way is simply by using the ``webpack_asset`` template tag."
msgstr "La primer forma es simplemente usando la plantilla de etiqueta ``webpack_asset``."

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:16
msgid "The second way is if a Kolibri Module needs to load in the template defined by another plugin or a core part of Kolibri, a template tag and hook can be defined to register that Kolibri Module's assets to be loaded on that page. An example of this is found in the ``base.html`` template using the ``webpack_base_assets`` tag."
msgstr "La segunda forma es que si Módulo Kolibri necesita cargarse en la plantilla definida por otro plugin o una parte principal de Kolibri, una etiqueta de plantilla y un gancho pueden usarse para registrar que los componentes del Módulo Kolibri son cargados. Un ejemplo de esto se encuentra en la plantilla ``base.html`` usando la etiqueta ``webpack_base_assets``."

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:18
msgid "This relies on the following function to collect all registered Kolibri Modules and load them synchronously: ``kolibri.core.webpack.utils.webpack_asset_render``"
msgstr "Esto se basa en la siguiente función para colectar todos los registros en los Módulos Kolibri y cargarlos sincronicamente:``kolibri.core.webpack.utils.webpack_asset_render``"

#: ../../dev/asset_loading.rst:20
msgid "Asynchronous loading can also, analogously, be done in two ways. Asynchronous loading registers a Kolibri Module against ``kolibriGlobal`` on the frontend at page load, but does not load, or execute any of the code until the events that the Kolibri Module specifies are triggered. When these are triggered, the ``kolibriGlobal`` will load the Kolibri Module and pass on any callbacks once it has initialized. Asynchronous loading can be done either explicitly with a template tag that directly imports a single Kolibri Module using ``webpack_base_async_assets``."
msgstr "La carga asincronica puede también, de forma análoga, ser realizada de dos maneras. Los registros de la carga asincronica del modulo Kolibri contra``kolibriGlobal`` en el interfaz de la carga de la pagina, pero esto no carga, o ejecuta ningún código hasta que los eventos que el Modulo Kolibri especifique sean activadas. Cuando estos sean activados el``kolibriGlobal`` cargara el modulo Kolibri y transmitir cualquier devolución de llamada una vez que se ha inicializado. La carga asíncrona puede hacerse ya sea de forma explícita con una etiqueta de plantilla que importa directamente un solo modulo Kolibri usando ``webpack_base_async_assets``."
