## How can I contribute?

1. 📙 **Skim through the [Developer documentation](https://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io)** to understand where to refer later on.
2. 💻 **Follow the [Getting started](https://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started.html) to set up your development server.** Some of the [How To Guides](https://kolibri-dev.readthedocs.io/en/develop/howtos/index.html#howtos) may be handy too.
3. 🔍 **Search for issues tagged as [help wanted](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+no%3Aassignee) or [good first issue](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee).**
4. 🗣️ **Ask us for an assignment in the comments of an issue you've chosen.** Please request assignment of a reasonable amount of issues at a time. Once you finish your current issue or two, you are welcome to ask for more.
