Feature: Coach creates quizzes
  Coach needs to be able to create quizzes from existing content

  Background:
    Given I am signed in to Kolibri as a coach user
      And I am on the *Coach > Plan > Quizzes* page

  Scenario: Create new quiz
    When I click the *New quiz* button
    Then I see a new *Create new quiz* page
      And I see empty *Title* field, and the default value of 10 in the *Number of questions* field
      And I see a list of channels that contain exercises
        But I don't see any checkboxes

  # Given there are no channels that have exercises
  # Then there should not be any channels available to select
  Scenario: Try and fail to create new quiz when no channel on device contains exercises
    When I click the *New quiz* button
    Then I see a new *Create new quiz* page
      And I see empty *Title* and *Number of questions* fields
      But I don't see any channels

  Scenario: Check validation for the number of questions field
    When I input a number outside the range of 1-50
      And I leave the input field or attempt to continue or finish the quiz
    Then the input field has the red outline
    When I input a number greater than amount of exercise questions
      And I leave the input field or attempt to continue or finish the quiz
    Then the number is cut out at 50
    When I don't input anything into the number field
      And I leave the input field or attempt to continue or finish the quiz
    Then an input validation error appears
    # This is not working right, quiz is saved even if the number of questions is left empty
