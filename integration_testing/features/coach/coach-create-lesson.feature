Feature: Coach creates lessons
  Coach needs to be able to create lessons from existing content

  Background:
    Given I am signed in to Kolibri as a coach user
      And I am on the *Coach - '<class>' > Plan > Lessons* page
      And there is a channel <channel> and topic <topic> on the device

  Scenario: Coach creates a new lesson for entire class
    When I click *New lesson* button
    Then I see the *Create new lesson* modal
    When I fill in the title for the <lesson>
      And I fill in the description <description> # optional
      And I set *Recipients* to group(s) # optional
      And I click *Continue* button
    Then the modal closes
      And I see the <lesson> lesson page

  Scenario: Check validation for the title field
    When I try to enter a title with more than 50 characters
    Then I see that the name is cut at 50
    When I input a same lesson title as for an already existing lesson
    Then I see the error notification *A lesson with this name already exists*
    When I leave the title field empty
      And I click *Continue*
    Then I see the error notification *This field is required*

  Scenario: Assign existing lesson to different recipient groups
    # Repeat the scenario from the *Coach - '<class>' > Report > Lessons > '<lesson>'* page
    When I change *Recipients* by selecting *Entire class* or one of the groups
      And I click the *Save changes* button
    Then I see the lesson <lesson> page again
      And the *Recipients* field reflects the changes I made

  Scenario: Assign individual learners
    When I change *Recipients* by selecting *Individual learners*
    Then I see a table listing all of the learners in the class.
    When I change *Recipients* by selecting both *Individual learners* and any other group that has learners
    Then I see the learners in the selected group(s) have the checkboxes by their names disabled
    When I select learners in the table by clicking the checkboxes next to their names
      And I click *Save changes*
    Then I can log in as one of the selected individual learners and view the lesson
    When I change *Recipients* by selecting *Entire class* then all groups and *Individual learners* become unchecked
      And I no longer see the table of learners
