Feature: Coach changes profile information
  Coach needs to be able to change their own profile information

  Background:
    Given I am signed in to Kolibri as a coach user
      And I am on my user *Profile* page
      And I have permission to edit my full name and username

  Scenario: Coach changes username and full name
     When I change my full name
      And I change my username
      And if my changes are valid (I did not leave the fields empty)
      And I click the “Save changes” button
     Then I see the *Profile details updated* inline notification
      And I see the new full name and username on the profile page
      And I see the new username in the user menu

  Scenario: Coach changes password
     When I click the “Change password” link
     Then I see the “Change password” modal
     When I enter the new password
      And I re-enter the new password
      And if my changes are valid (I did not leave the fields empty, or entered two different passwords)
      And I click the “Update” button
    Then I see the *Password updated* snackbar notification
