Feature: Learner finds content item
  Learner needs to be able to search and find content items using the search bar

  Background:
    Given I am signed in to Kolibri as a Learner user
      And there is a channel <channel> imported on the device
      And I am on any of the tabs inside *Learn*

  Scenario: Find a specific content item using the search bar
    When I enter the <search_term> in the search field
     And I press the ENTER key or click the search icon button
    Then I see the *Search > N results for '<search_term>'* page

  Scenario: Clear the previous search
    Given that I've written something in the search field
      When I use the TAB key to focus the *Clear* button
        And I press ENTER
          Or I click/tap the *Clear* button directly
      Then I see the search field is empty
        But I can still see the results of the previous search

  Scenario: Filter search results
    When I open the *Type* filter and select a type
    Then I see the results are filtered
      And I see the *M results for '<search_term>'*
    When I open the *Channels* filter and select a channel
    Then I see the results are filtered even more
      And I see the *Q results for '<search_term>'*
    When I click the *X* (clear) button
    Then the search field is empty
      And I can write the new search term
        But I can still see the results of the previous search

  Scenario: Browse locations for the multiple search results
    Given there is a search result item that is present in various channels and/or locations
      When I click the *N locations* link on one of the items
      Then I see the *Locations* modal
        And I see the list of links to N locations where the search result item is present
      When I click one of the links
      Then I see the *Search > '<content item>'> page
      When I click the *X* icon in the left upper corner
      Then I see the results of the previous search
      When I click the *N locations* link on one of the items
      Then I see the *Locations* modal again
      When I click *Close*
      Then the modal closes
        And I see the results of the previous search

Examples:
  | search_term |
  | cosine      |
