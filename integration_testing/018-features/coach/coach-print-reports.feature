Feature: Coaches need to be able to print or save as PDF all the available views inside the *Reports* tab and its subtabs

  Background:
    Given I am signed in as a facility or class coach
      And I am on *Coach > Reports* tab
      And there are learners divided into groups <group1> and <group2> in the <class>
      And there are <quiz1> and <quiz2> that some of the learners have started and/or completed
      And there are <lesson1> and <lesson2> that some of the learners have interacted with
      And I have access to a working paper printer device
      And my browser is capable of saving files in the PDF format

  Scenario: Print report (for all)
    When I click the *Print report* button
    Then I see the default print dialog for my chosen browser
    When I select my paper printer device
      And I make other adjustments in the printer settings according to my needs # quality, margins, etc.
      And I confirm # could be *Print* or *OK* depending on the browser
    Then I have a paper version of the report

  Scenario: Save report as PDF (for all)
    When I click the *Print report* button
    Then I see the default print dialog for my chosen browser
    When I select *Save as PDF* # wording might be different depending on the browser
        And I make other adjustments in the PDF settings according to my needs # headings, margins, etc.
        And I confirm # could be *Save* or *OK* depending on the browser
      Then I have a PDF version of the report
