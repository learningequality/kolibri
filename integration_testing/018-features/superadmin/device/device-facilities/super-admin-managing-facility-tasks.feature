Feature: Managing facility tasks
  Users need to be able to view and manage the tasks for their facility

  Background:
    Given I am signed in as a super admin
      And I have at least one facility on my device
      And I am in *Device > Facilities*
      And I successfully started a sync task
      And I see at least one task in the task manager

  Scenario: Sync task is successful
    When I click *View task manager*
    Then I see the sync task I started
      And I see it has the *Waiting* status
      And I see a clock icon
      And I see the name of the device it is syncing with
      And I see the 4 digit unique ID of the device it is syncing with
      And I see an icon for the OS of the device
      And I see the network address of the device it is syncing with
      And I see my username in *Started by '<username>'*
      And I see a *Cancel* button for the task
    When the sync task begins
    Then I see *1 of 7 - Establishing connection*
      And I see an indeterminate spinner
    When this step is finished
    Then I see *2 of 7 - Remotely preparing data*
    When this step is finished
    Then I see *3 of 7 - Receiving data*
    When this step is finished
    Then I see *4 of 7 - Locally integrating received data*

    Then I see *5 of 7 - Locally preparing data to send*
    When this step is finished
    Then I see *6 of 7 - Sending data*
    When this step is finished
    Then I see *7 of 7 - Remotely integrating data*
    When this step is finished
    Then I see *Finished* status
      And I see a green check icon
      And I see how many MB were sent
      And I see how many MB were received
      And I see a *Clear* button for the task

      When I click *Clear*
