"""
We have three main abstractions: Users, Collections, and Roles. Users represent people, like students in a school,
teachers for a classroom, or volunteers setting up informal installations.

Collections are hierarchical groups of users. Users belong to one or more Collections, and Collections can belong to
other Collections. Collections are subdivided into several pre-defined levels.

Roles belong to collections, and represent permissions. Users have one or more Roles. For instance, Classes (a type
of Collection) have an associated Coach Role -- that Coach has permission to view related User data for Users in the
Class.
