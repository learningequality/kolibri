# This is necessary because:
# 1. The list generator has an unpredictable order, and when items swap places
#    then this would be picked up as a change in Django if we had used
# 2. These choices can be changed in facility_configuration_presets.json
#    and such change should not warrant warnings that models are inconsistent
#    as it has no impact.
# Notice: The 'choices' property of a field does NOT have any impact on DB
# See: https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/pull/3180
