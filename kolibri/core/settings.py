"""
Kolibri core settings module
============================

This module is *not* the project settings but defines variables that can be
configured through the project settings - and their defaults.

If something in the core uses a custom project setting, it should use a
naming scheme in django.conf.settings like ``KOLIBRI_*``.

Please avoid depending on settings in kolibri.deployments.default.settings,
rather define the default here so we don't have multiple layers of defaults.
