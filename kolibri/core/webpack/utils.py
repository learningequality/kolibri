"""
This module manages the interface between webpack and Django.
It loads webpack bundle tracker stats files, and catalogues the different files
that need to be served in order to inject that frontend code into a Django template.
Originally, it was a monkeypatch of django-webpack-loader - but as our needs are somewhat
different, much of the code has simply been rewritten, and will continue to be done so to better much our use case.
