    A hook to allow plugins to register callbacks for sync events they're interested in.

    There are two options for hooking into sync: the *_transfer hooks and sync operations.
    - Errors raised in the pre_transfer and post_transfer hooks will not cause sync to fail, so use
      them for behaviors that are auxiliary to the integrity of the sync.
    - Errors raised in operations will cause the sync to fail, so use them for behaviors that are
      vital to the sync process.
