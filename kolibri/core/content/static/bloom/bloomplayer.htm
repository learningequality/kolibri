    <!-- At build time, we insert a script tag pointing at bloomPlayer.min.js but with a hash created at build time,
        to avoid getting a stale version from a cache (while allowing us to cache it for a long time).
        It has a style sheet which sets the same color on the body, but it takes a while to fetch and load,
        so we reduce flicker by setting a background color explicitly. -->
