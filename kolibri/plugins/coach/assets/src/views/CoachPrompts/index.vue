      Blended learning implementation models
    </h3>

    <p>
      Whole class model
    </p>
    <p>
      Definition?
    </p>
    <p>
      Example
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is how a school in Guatemala adapted the whole class model by bridging technology with traditional instruction for a Math lesson. During the lesson all learners -
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Viewed a Kolibri resource on a projector
      </li>
      <li>
        Practiced Kolibri exercises independently
      </li>
      <li>
        Engaged in another coach-led activity without using any technology
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Rotation model
    </p>
    <p>
      Learners rotate on a fixed schedule between activities in small groups, individually or as a whole class. One of the activities (or "stations") that learners rotate through is using Kolibri
    </p>
    <p>
      Example 1
    </p>
    <p>
      The image below is an example of a rotation model with 2 stations. Learners rotate in small groups / individually / as a whole class between these stations
    </p>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <p>Station 1</p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Example 2
    </p>
    <p>
      The image below is a rotation model example with 3 learning stations. Learners can rotate in small groups/individually or as a whole class between these stations. Station 3 can include worksheets, free time or related small group work
    </p>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>

      Peer Tutoring
    </p>
    <p>
      Coach pairs learners to help one another understand concepts on Kolibri. This promotes learner empowerment through teaching one another and frees up time for the coach to assist those who need additional support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential pairing options
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learner who has already mastered a topic with a learner who could benefit from review
      </li>
      <li>
        Learners with similar mastery levels to facilitate progressing through new content at similar rates
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Roving Teacher
    </p>
    <p>
      Coach moves around the classroom while learners work independently or in pairs/groups on Kolibri, stepping in for assistance as needed. The coach can -
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide supplemental support to learners
      </li>
      <li>
        Deliver small group lessons or 1-1 interventions as needed
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ideal for the coach who wants to use time more effectively with learners who need it most, through individual attention or organizing groups of multiple struggling learners
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Supplementary resource
    </p>
    <p>
      In this model, technology is available within the classroom, or after class time in a library or resource room. Learners access Kolibri to review content, check understanding, and follow their own interests
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Reflect
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What are the potential benefits and disadvantages of each model?
      </li>
      <li>
        What help or assistance would you need to implement these different models?
      </li>
      <li>
        What changes would you need to make in your current teaching style to try these different models?

    <h3>
      Strategies to group learners and address learning needs
    </h3>

    <p>
      The "Group" feature in Kolibri will allow you to meet learning needs of different learners
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating "groups"

    <ul>
      <li>
        What are your goals when grouping learners?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do you want groups where all learners are the same level or different levels?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can you best support the varying needs of your learners?
      </li>
      <li>
        How often would the groups change?
      </li>
      <li>
        Will learners be in multiple groups at the same time according to needs?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <p>
      Give them an example:
    </p>

      <li>
        Something that I have noticed - Distributing devices takes a long time
      </li>
      <li>
        A change I would like to see - Faster distributing and collection of devices
      </li>
      <li>
        A rule I would like to suggest - Assign 2 learners to distribute and collect devices

    </ul>
    <p>
      Step 3
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      Step 4
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ask learners to work in groups and discuss various suggestions
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask a learner in each group to take notes and report to the class later
      </li>
      <li>
        After all reports are heard, write the suggestions on the board and work on it more with your learners and prepare a class charter
      </li>
