    <h3>Blended learning implementation models</h3>

    <p>Whole class model</p>
    <p>Definition?</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>
      Here is how a school in Guatemala adapted the whole class model by bridging technology with
      traditional instruction for a Math lesson. During the lesson all learners -
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Viewed a Kolibri resource on a projector</li>
      <li>Practiced Kolibri exercises independently</li>
      <li>Engaged in another coach-led activity without using any technology</li>
    </ul>
    <hr >
    <p>Rotation model</p>
    <p>
      Learners rotate on a fixed schedule between activities in small groups, individually or as a
      whole class. One of the activities (or "stations") that learners rotate through is using
      Kolibri
    </p>
    <p>Example 1</p>
    <p>
      The image below is an example of a rotation model with 2 stations. Learners rotate in small
      groups / individually / as a whole class between these stations
    </p>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <p>Station 1</p>
            <p>Kolibri learning</p>
          </th>
          <td><img src="./kolibri.png" ></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <p>Station 2</p>
            <p>Guided practice</p>
          </th>
          <td><img src="./guided.png" ></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>Example 2</p>
    <p>
      The image below is a rotation model example with 3 learning stations. Learners can rotate in
      small groups/individually or as a whole class between these stations. Station 3 can include
      worksheets, free time or related small group work
    </p>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <p>Station 1</p>
            <p>Kolibri learning</p>
          </th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <p>Station 2</p>
            <p>Guided practice</p>
          </th>
          <td><img src="./guided.png" ></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <p>Station 3</p>

    </div>
    <p>Peer Tutoring</p>
    <p>
      Coach pairs learners to help one another understand concepts on Kolibri. This promotes learner
      empowerment through teaching one another and frees up time for the coach to assist those who
      need additional support.
    </p>
    <p>Potential pairing options</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learner who has already mastered a topic with a learner who could benefit from review</li>
      <li>
        Learners with similar mastery levels to facilitate progressing through new content at
        similar rates
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr >
    <p>Roving Teacher</p>
    <p>
      Coach moves around the classroom while learners work independently or in pairs/groups on
      Kolibri, stepping in for assistance as needed. The coach can -
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide supplemental support to learners</li>
      <li>Deliver small group lessons or 1-1 interventions as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ideal for the coach who wants to use time more effectively with learners who need it most,
      through individual attention or organizing groups of multiple struggling learners
    </p>
    <hr >
    <p>Supplementary resource</p>
    <p>
      In this model, technology is available within the classroom, or after class time in a library
      or resource room. Learners access Kolibri to review content, check understanding, and follow
      their own interests
    </p>
    <hr >
    <p>Reflect</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are the potential benefits and disadvantages of each model?</li>
      <li>What help or assistance would you need to implement these different models?</li>
      <li>
        What changes would you need to make in your current teaching style to try these different
        models?
      </li>
    </ul>
