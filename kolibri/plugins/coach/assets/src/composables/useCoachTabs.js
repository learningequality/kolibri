/**
 * Provides a place to store last tabs interaction
 * and helper methods to save and retrieve it.
 * This information is typically used to find out
 * if a tab was clicked recently so that we can decide
 * on whether we should programatically re-focus it after
 * navigating to a page.
 *
 * Motivation: Our routing architecture where parts of a page
 * containing tabs get reloaded on route change would result
 * in losing focus from the active tab. Therefore, we need
 * to programatically re-focus after components are mounted again.
 * However, for that we need to be able to estimate when navigation
 * occured as a result of user interaction with tabs because in other
 * cases focus shouldn't be manipulated (e.g. when visiting a page for
 * the first time before clicking on tabs) .
 *
 * Usage: When tabs are clicked, save that interaction by calling `saveTabsClick`.
 * Then when you need find out if tabs were clicked recently,
 * call `wereTabsClickedRecently`.
