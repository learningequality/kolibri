00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.960
Find the value of 5 to
the third power.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.020
Let me rewrite that.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.910
We have 5 to the third power.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.340
Now, it's important to remember,
this does not

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.630
mean 5 times 3.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.770
This means 5 times itself three
times, so this is equal

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.690
to 5 times 5 times 5.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.930
5 times 3, just as a bit of a
refresher so you realize the

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.680
difference, 5 times 3-- let
me write it over here.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:41.370
5 times 3 is equal to
5 plus 5 plus 5.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
So when you multiply by 3,
you're adding the number to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.690
itself three times.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.520
When you take it to the third
power, you're multiplying the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.980
number by itself three times.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.720
So 5 times 3, you've seen
that before, that's 15.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.650
But 5 to the third power, 5
times itself three times, is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.400
equal to-- well, 5 times 5 is
25, and then 25 times 5 is

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.760
125, so this is equal to 125.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.270
And we're done!
